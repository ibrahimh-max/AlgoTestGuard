ðŸ”’ AlgoTestGuard
VS Code extension + Python toolkit for unit testing and security auditing Algorand smart contracts (TEAL / PyTeal).

ðŸš€ What is AlgoTestGuard?
Algorand developers often struggle with testing and auditing their smart contracts before deployment. Unlike Ethereum, which has mature tools like Slither and MythX, the Algorand ecosystem lacks beginner-friendly testing + security automation.

AlgoTestGuard fills that gap by providing:

âœ… Auto-generated unit test templates for PyTeal contracts (saves time & enforces testing habits).

ðŸ”’ Static security analysis to catch common pitfalls (missing fee checks, no approval logic, unsafe patterns).

ðŸ“Š Exportable audit reports (Markdown/HTML/JSON) for easy sharing with teams or auditors.

ðŸ§© A future-proof VS Code extension and CI/CD integration, so teams can use it in everyday development.

This project is designed to be highly reusable and scalable, aiming to become the standard developer tool for Algorand smart contracts.
